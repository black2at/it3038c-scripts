### LAB 7

======

Lab 7 is a demonstration of the tinytag library for python.
This library allows the user to get information from a music file such as an mp3 or FLAC

The lab 7 app demonstrates some of the information that can be gained from the file such as the artist, album, track number, and genre of the song.

The only thing the app will need is an input to a file that is formatted as such:

C:/Users/airle/Music/American Idiot/Green Day - American Idiot.flac
