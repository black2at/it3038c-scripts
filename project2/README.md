# Project 2

======


This library allows the user to get information from a music file such as a .mp3, .FLAC, or .wav

My project 2 script demonstrates some of the information that can be gained from the file such as the artist, album, track number, and genre of the song. 
The output will be compiled and stored in a csv file with the title being the same as the track that has been input into the script.

The only thing the app will need is an input to a file that is formatted as such:

C:/Users/airle/Music/American Idiot/Green Day - American Idiot.flac
